# AI PLAYING CHECKERS
This is a project dedicated to creating and training an AI to play pro level checkers/draughts for UAF CS 405/605.  
# Versions
Version 0:  
- All relevant current files added.
- Board object creates a 12 by 12 board with a boarder with width of 2.
- Board object correctly generates Piece objects according to playable positions.
- Board function print_board displays Board object for debugging purposes.
- Piece objects display correct \*true positions and directions (\*numerical position starting at top left and incrementing right).
- Piece objects may become king, however no movements currently allow it.
- main.cpp draws the Board object and displays existing Piece values.
# Note
Not sure how I ended up with a folder within but I removed all the extra Visual Studio stuff. Let me know if there is a way I can fix it if it matters a lot.
Tried to fix it but now we have two copies, one in the folder and one out.
